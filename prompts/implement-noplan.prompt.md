CP, please use the file "{{file}}" to generate the complete program described in the requirements. The review is finished, and the requirements are considered clear and implementation-ready.

Your task is to produce high-quality, production-ready code that fulfills all requirements. Please:

- Generate all necessary files, modules, classes, functions, and configuration.
- Use clear, maintainable, idiomatic code appropriate for the chosen language or framework.
- Include comments where helpful for clarity.
- Implement error handling, validation, and edge-case coverage as described in the plan.
- Ensure the code is consistent with the requirements and acceptance criteria.
- If the requirements reference external services, APIs, or integrations, include stubs or full implementations as appropriate.
- If any part of the requirements appears contradictory or incomplete, pause and call it out before proceeding.

Output the code in a structured, organized way so a developer can copy it directly into a project. If multiple files are required, clearly label each file and its path.

Keep the implementation focused, complete, and aligned with the requirements.
